## Federal Electoral Districts

Canadian federal electoral districts are represented by the following naming policy:
* All current divisions are given an ID, based on their name.
* All divisions that are abolished according to the Library of Parliament are given an ID, based on their name.
* If multiple current/abolished divisions have the same ID, later divisions are suffixed with the validFrom year.
* All divisions that were renamed according to the Library of Parliament are aliases (sameAs) to another ID.
* A province/territory:id pair is prefixed to the ed:id pair, since two provinces can contain the same district name.
* The most recent ID is the "canonical" ID. Previous renames are aliased to it.

Up until November 2022, Canadian federal electoral districts were represented with [federal electoral district codes](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=cir/list&document=index338&lang=e) where the year in which the redistricting was completed would be appended to the file name (i.e. ca\_federal\_electoral\_districts-2013.csv).
